KitchenManager2020 is a futuristic simulator of a smart kitchen in 2020.
The idea is that food stuffs are scanned automatically when entering the
kitchen's various storage facilities. Thus the KitchenManager2020 can 
calculate if certain recipes can be made or not, and optionally suggest
a grocery list if ingredients are needed. The user should be able to
report that a recipe has been made or that a product has been removed 
from the kitchen.
